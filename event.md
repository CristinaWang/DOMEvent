# DOM Event

## Background
Click, touch, load, drag, change, input, error, resize — [the list of possible DOM events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event) is lengthy. Events can be triggered on any part of a document, whether by a user’s interaction or by the browser. They don’t just start and end in one place; they flow through the document, on a life cycle of their own. This life cycle is what makes DOM events so extensible and useful. As a developer, you should understand how DOM events work, so that you can harness their potential and build engaging experiences.
